I valued learning about HTML because I do some modding for games that were made back in the early 2000s. Often I have to alter the HTML or at least view one, but I had never understood what they represent. Learning that HTML's have elements that cover content within the HTML made it much easier to understand for me. It will take me a long time to learn the language, but with practice and training I know I'll be able to read it like a second language. 

The table of contents given in the textbook truly helped me understand the labeling in HTML's. What clicks is how to read whats inside of an HTML. Like with a programming language, being able to read certain terms that represent a language for the computer is key to understanding this concept. 

I will be using this knowledge everyday for the rest of my life as a tech nerd. HTML is the life and blood of technological functions, and I look forward to put these skills into practice.
