In this lesson I learned the differences between HTML and CSS formatting. CSS is able to strip down HTML to its fundamentals, making it easier to understand and edit.

I didn't understand the difference between the two until the graphic of CCS in the CSS box model. The visualization allowed me to understand how CCS formats code.

For the final project, I look forward to switching between CSS and HTML to complete my website.
