In today's lesson, I learned how to properly use the tools of Dreamweaver's sidebar to simplify the work load. Dreamweaver looks complex on the outside, but throughout my reading the systems used to edit HTML files are simpler than I thought. I struggled to understand what the ribbon tools and sidebar tasks meant, until I delved into the text book. Its overwhelming to look at all at once, but breaking down each section makes understanding Dreamweaver much simpler. 

Since I am new to Dreamweaver, everything I read was new to me. However, while reading I would copy the text book and practiced on the lesson files provided. If the text book showed me how to split my screen, I would repeat that process. Sometimes I can't visualize what the textbook requires, so I watch a video to understand how the computer system works.

I will be using all of the skills provided throughout this course. This lesson seems like the building blocks of using Dreamweaver, and I will be replicating the tool usage throughout this course.
